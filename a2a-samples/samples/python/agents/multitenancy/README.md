# A2A Multi-Tenancy Example — Many Agents, One Host

This sample shows how to host **three independent A2A agents behind a single
server** using **URL sub-path routing**.

The three agents are intentionally trivial "echo-style" mocks — the focus is on
*routing*, not on what the agents do:

| Sub-path | Agent | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/hello` | Hello World Agent | Replies with a friendly hello |
| `/palindrome` | Palindrome Agent | Says whether your text is a palindrome |
| `/reverse` | Word Reverse Agent | Reverses the order of your words |

## A2A Multi-Tenancy with URL sub-path routing

In A2A, multi-tenancy is possible in three ways:
1. URL sub-path routing
2. Authentication header-based routing
3. Body-based routing with the `tenant` field

The following sample focuses on URL sub-path routing. Refer to [A2A Multi-Tenancy](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/topics/multi-tenancy/) for more information on the other two approaches.

### URL sub-path routing

In this approach, each agent gets its own URL prefix and advertises that URL in its own Agent
Card. Clients need no special awareness — they read the card and send requests
where it points. It's the simplest, most transparent option: you can read the
route straight out of an access log.

    Client(["🤖 Client"])
    subgraph Host["One host : 127.0.0.1:9999"]
        H["/hello — Hello World Agent"]
        P["/palindrome — Palindrome Agent"]
        R["/reverse — Word Reverse Agent"]
    end
    Client -- "POST /hello" --> H
    Client -- "POST /palindrome" --> P
    Client -- "POST /reverse" --> R
```

In this sample, `a2a_server.py` mounts each agent's Agent Card and JSON-RPC
endpoint on its own sub-path, and `a2a_client.py` discovers each agent by reading
its card and then sends requests to the URL the card advertises.

## Run it

Prerequisites: Python 3.10+ and the A2A SDK. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. **Start the server** (hosts all three agents on port 9999):

   ```bash
   python a2a_server.py
   ```

   It prints the sub-path each agent is mounted on:

   ```text
   Serving three A2A agents (bind 127.0.0.1:9999, public http://127.0.0.1:9999):
     http://127.0.0.1:9999/hello  ->  Hello World Agent
     http://127.0.0.1:9999/palindrome  ->  Palindrome Agent
     http://127.0.0.1:9999/reverse  ->  Word Reverse Agent
   ```

2. **Run the client** in a second terminal. It discovers all three agents, shows
   a menu, and lets you chat with the one you pick:

   ```bash
   python a2a_client.py                 # non-streaming replies (default)
   python a2a_client.py --mode stream   # streaming replies
   ```

   A session looks like this:

3. **Inspect a card** directly:

   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:9999/hello/.well-known/agent-card.json
   ```

## Test it

`test_demo_app.py` is a small `pytest` suite (in the same spirit as the
`helloworld` sample). It starts `a2a_server.py` as a subprocess, waits until it's
ready, then — for each of the three tenant agents — sends a text message and
checks that a text reply comes back (a black-box round-trip test per agent).

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest test_demo_app.py
```

## Configuration

The server reads **three environment variables**, so the same code
works whether you run it locally or behind a different public address:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `A2A_BIND_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Host/interface the server binds to (set to `0.0.0.0` to listen on all interfaces). |
| `A2A_PORT` | `9999` | Port the server listens on. |
| `A2A_PUBLIC_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:9999` | URL advertised in each Agent Card (what clients connect to). |

The client reads `A2A_PORT` too, so it targets the same port as the server.


## Disclaimer
**Important:** The sample code provided is for demonstration purposes and
illustrates the mechanics of the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. When building
production applications, it is critical to treat any agent operating outside of
your direct control as a potentially untrusted entity.

All data received from an external agent—including but not limited to its
AgentCard, messages, artifacts, and task statuses—should be handled as untrusted
input. For example, a malicious agent could provide an AgentCard containing
crafted data in its fields (e.g., description, name, skills.description). If
this data is used without sanitization to construct prompts for a Large Language
Model (LLM), it could expose your application to prompt injection attacks.
Failure to properly validate and sanitize this data before use can introduce
security vulnerabilities into your application.

Developers are responsible for implementing appropriate security measures, such
as input validation and secure handling of credentials to protect their systems
and users.
